# Prefix-Automaton
This program is a terminal based program, written in C, used to test knowledge on dynamic data structures. It is separated into 3 stages.

## Stage 0
This stage assembles the automaton, input a bunch of sentences (make sure to use '#' to denote a space), pressing enter to indicate a new line.
Once you've entered your sentences, press Ctrl-D and then stage 1 will begin.

## Stage 1
Here, the automaton has been constructed, you can write some prompts and the program will return a string which, in a way, finishes your sentence based on the
sentences you provided in stage 0.

## Stage 2
[!] Stage 2 doesn't work. I didn't finish in time.
Overall, stage 2 is essentially an optimization of the previous stages, compressing the automaton to have less branches (since it is stored in a tree-like structure).
I recommend ignoring stage 2, since all outputs are completely wrong.
